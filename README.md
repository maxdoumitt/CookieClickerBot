# CookieClickerBot
I made a bot to play Cookie Clicker automatically. :D
Made with pyautogui extension.
also I made it for the steam version so I don't know if the pixel locations match the browser version.
  (Only works on 1920x1080 screen resolution lol I won't be fixing that.)
  
  the very funny thing I've just realized is that if anyone tries to use this it won't work because it's very dependant on my save. thats kinda funny. seems like an astronomical amount of work to try to make it work from start to finish so don't count on it but it will still be code that looks kinda cool. I'll upload my saves from now on if I can figure out how.
